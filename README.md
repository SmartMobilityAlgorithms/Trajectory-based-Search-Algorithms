## Overview
Trajectory-based metaheuristic search algorithms such as simulated annealing uses a single agent or solution which moves through the design space or search space in a piece-wise style. A better move or solution is always accepted, while a not-so-good move can be accepted with certain probability. The steps or moves trace a trajectory in the search space, with a non-zero probability that this trajectory can reach the global optimum.
